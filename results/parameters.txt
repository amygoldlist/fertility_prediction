Using SVR with epsilon =0, kernel =rbf.
Find the optimal values of gamma and C using a gridsearch with 10-fold cross validation
Here, the scoring is the negative Mean Squared Error
{'C': 5000, 'gamma': 0.01}
cross validation score for model:  28.9593657826
The MSE is 5.53129102824e-08
The test MSE is 29.732378089
